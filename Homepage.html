			So what exactly is a Break Room?

	</center>

		<p style="font-family:Courier;font-size:14;">
			If your boss is giving you a hard time. Or your significant other is stressing you out. Or you had a break-up.
			</br>
		    Or you were stuck in B'lore traffic for hours! Or you are a student whose energy is getting drained uselessly. 
		    </br>
		    Or God forbid, your life is fucking you badly. Whatever your reason or maybe no reason at all, the Break Room
		    </br>
		    provides you with a place to let loose. You've tried Yoga and Meditation or Gym, try something different.
		    </br>
		    Break something or everything at the Break Room!
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:Courier;font-size:14;">
			Everybody wants to blow off steam in their own way. That's only natural. Some people go for a drive, others go for a run.
			<br/>
			At The Break Room we hit things. With bats. It's a little more liberating than the other stuff you do.
		    </br>
		    So come to the Break Room, pick up a bat, put on a Break Suit and feel good. 
		    </br>
		    You know you want to :')
