			So what exactly is a Break Room?

		<p style=" font-family: Courier; font-size: 14;color: lightblue; ">
			If your boss is giving you a hard time. Or your significant other is stressing you out. Or you had a break-up.
			</br>
		    Or you were stuck in B'lore traffic for hours! Or you are a student whose energy is getting drained uselessly. 
		    </br>
		    Or God forbid, your life is stressing you out badly. Whatever your reason or maybe no reason at all, The Break Room
		    </br>
		    provides you with a place to let loose. You've tried Yoga and Meditation or Gym, try something different.
		    </br>
		    Break something or everything at the Break Room!
		</p>
		<p style=" font-family: Courier; font-size: 14; color: lightblue; ">
			Everybody wants to blow off steam in their own way. That's only natural. Some people go for a drive, others go for a run.
			<br/>
			At The Break Room we hit things. With bats and anything you like. It's a little more liberating than the other stuff you do.
		    </br>
		    So come to the Break Room, pick up a bat, put on a Break Suit and feel good. 
		    </br>
		    You know you want to :')
